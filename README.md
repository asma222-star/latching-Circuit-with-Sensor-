# latching-Circuit-with-Sensor-
This project presents a latching power switch circuit with auto power ON/OFF capabilities.
 It uses a combination of digital logic, analog components, and microcontroller programming to control the power state of a device with minimal energy loss and intelligent behavior.
Ideal for applications like battery-powered devices, robots, or smart systems where manual and automatic control of power is required.

‚öôÔ∏è Features
‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Latching ON/OFF with a push button
‚Ä¢	üîÅ Automatic power off after a defined period of inactivity or based on sensor input
‚Ä¢	‚ö° Power ON via button or condition (e.g., voltage threshold, motion, etc.)
‚Ä¢	üß† Microcontroller-based logic for smart control
‚Ä¢	üí° Supports both digital input triggers and analog signal thresholds


Components:
1.	IRF 44N P-channel Mosfet- this component is used to enable the supply between the battery and microcontroller.
2.	BC 547 BJT transistor- this component is used to trigger the mosfet transistor on/off.
3.	Resistor 100k, 10k and 1M- this component is used to resist the current or electricity flow.
4.	‚Å†vibration sensor- this component is used to trigger the circuit on or off
5.	‚Å†Arduino microcontrollers- this component is used to trigger automatic signal to switch off the latch circuit.
